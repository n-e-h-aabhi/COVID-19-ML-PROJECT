PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given data about COVID-19 patients, write the code to visualize the impact and
analyse the trend of rate of infection and recovery as well as make predictions
about the number of cases expected a week in future based on the current
trends. Given CSV and Excel files containing data about the number of COVID-19
active, confirmed, deaths and recovered patients both around the world and in
India.
Guidelines:
● Use pandas to accumulate data from multiple data files.
● Use plotly (visualization library) to create interactive visualizations.
● Use Facebook prophet library to make time series models.
● Visualize the prediction by combining these technologies

OBJECTIVE
The objective of COVID-19 project is to generate knowledge and insights that
can inform effective responses to the pandemic, protect public health, and
mitigate the social, economic, and health impacts of COVID-19 on a global scale.
To develop a comprehensive data-driven analysis and visualization tool for
understanding the impact of COVID-19, including trends in infection and
recovery rates, and to utilize predictive modeling techniques to forecast the
number of cases expected in the near future. By interactive visualization, and
time series modeling, the project aims to provide insights into the spread of the
virus and enhance public understanding of the ongoing pandemic. To visualise
the Active, Confirmed, Recovered and Death cases using plotly library and
forecasting for the next 7 days using Facebook prophet library.

DATA PREPROCESSING STEPS AND INSPIRATION
The preprocessing of the data include the following steps:
* Renaming the columns - For easy handling of the data.
* Data Cleaning:
1. Check for null values - To remove/replace null values to increase accuracy.
2. Check for duplicates – To remove the duplicated records to increase
accuracy
* Data Aggregation:
1. Aggregate data by date to analyze trends over time.
2. Summarize data at different geographical levels (e.g., country) understand
regional variations in infection rates.
INSPIRATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked significant interest in
understanding and analysing the spread of the virus, making it a relevant and
timely topic for exploration.

CHOOSING THE ALGORITHM
* Data Visualization: I have chosen plotly library since it is a highlevel data
visualization library in which we can create interactive plots and dashboards,
that can be useful for exploring trends of rate of infection and recovery over
time.
* Time Series Forecasting: I have chosen FB Prophet library for forecasting
since it is an open source forecasting tool developed by Facebook and here
we don’t need to make the data stationary. It is designed for creating
accurate time series forecast. Since COVID-19 data typically involves time-
series data (e.g., daily or weekly counts of cases), algorithms specialized in
time series forecasting are suitable. Facebook Prophet, as mentioned in the
project guidelines, is a best choice for this task. It handles trends and
seasonality effects automatically, making it suitable for modeling COVID-19
case counts over time. It can be used to forecast the number of COVID-19
cases expected in the future based on historical data.

ASSUMPTIONS
* Data Accuracy: It is assumed that the data used for analysis is accurate and
reliable. Any inconsistencies or errors in the data could affect the results and
predictions.
* Uniform Testing and Reporting: The analysis assumes that COVID-19 testing
and reporting are conducted uniformly across regions and time periods. In
reality, testing rates may vary due to factors such as healthcare capacity,
testing policies, and socioeconomic factors, leading to potential biases in the
data.
* Predictive Power: The predictive models used in the analysis are assumed to
have the ability to forecast future COVID-19 cases based on historical data.
The accuracy of these predictions may vary depending on the complexity of
the model and the quality of the data.

MODEL EVALUATION AND TECHNIQUES
When evaluating the model we typically follow these steps:
* Preparation of Training data : Prepare the historical time series data,
ensuring it has a suitable format with a datetime column and the target
variable we want to forecast.
* Model Initialization: Initialize a Prophet model object and optionally set any
relevant parameters like seasonality, holidays, and growth.
from fbprophet import Prophet
           model = Prophet()
* Fit the Model: Fit the Prophet model to your training data using the fit
method.
           model.fit(data_train)
* Forecast Generation: Generate forecasts using the trained model. We can
specify the number of periods in future that we want to forecast using
make_future_dataframe() method and then make predictions using the
predict method.
          future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=365)
# Example: forecast for 1 year into the future
forecast = model.predict(future)
* Visual Evaluation: Plot the actual values against the predicted values to
visually inspect how well the model performs on the training data.
           model.plot(forecast)

INFERENCES
* Trend Analysis: The project can reveal the trend of COVID-19 cases over
time, highlighting periods of rapid spread or decline. This information can
help identify the effectiveness of interventions and guide future public health
strategies.
* Prediction of Future Cases: The predictive models developed in the project
can forecast the number of COVID-19 cases expected in the future based on
current trends. These predictions can inform resource allocation and
healthcare planning efforts.
* Interactive Visualization: Through interactive visualizations created with
Plotly, the project facilitates exploration and interpretation of COVID-19 data.
* Epidemiological Trends: Comparison of COVID-19 trends across countries
reveals variations in the timing, intensity, and duration of outbreaks. Some
countries may experience rapid surges in cases followed by declines, while
others may see more prolonged waves of infection.
* The project concludes that United States is having the most number of
Confirmed,Active,Recovered and Death cases .

FUTURE POSSIBILITIES
* Risk Assessment and Decision Support: Provide decision-makers to look real-
time risk assessments and decision support tools to guide pandemic response
efforts. This includes scenario planning, sensitivity analysis, and cost-benefit
analysis of different mitigation strategies.
* Vaccination Impact Assessment: Evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination
campaigns in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and reducing the severity of
cases. Analyze vaccination coverage over time to assess the long-term impact
on COVID 19.
* Variant Analysis: Monitor the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants,
assessing their potential for increased transmissibility, vaccine evasion, or
severity of illness. Utilize genomic sequencing data and epidemiological
surveillance to understand the prevalence and trajectory of different
variants.

CONCLUSION
The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and wide-ranging effects on
communities around the world, with significant variations observed across
different countries. By understanding the lessons learned from the pandemic
and addressing the challenges identified, countries can better prepare for and
mitigate the impact of future public health crises.
In conclusion, the COVID-19 analysis project, utilizing Facebook Prophet for time
series forecasting and Plotly for interactive visualization, provides valuable
insights into the dynamics of the pandemic and aids in informed decision-
making. Through rigorous data analysis and modeling, the project identifies
trends, patterns, and predictive factors associated with COVID-19 transmission,
recovery, and response measures. In summary, the COVID-19 analysis project
serves as a valuable tool for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to the
evolving challenges posed by the pandemic
